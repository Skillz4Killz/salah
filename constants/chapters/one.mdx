# What is Salah?
<SectionDescription>Do you think Salat is prayer? You are wrong!</SectionDescription>

### Definition of Salah

In order to perfect our salat, we must first understand what salat means. Salat is usually translated into english as prayer, but in fact salat is not prayer. There is no word in the english language that can truly translate salah. In fact, some people may have already noticed that salat has already been spelled in two different ways in this page alone.

#### Salat or Salah?

It is spelled as salat and salah. The reason for this is because in arabic when we say salat in the middle of a sentence it is sounded with a “t” sound but when used at the end of a sentence it is sounded with a “h” sound. Arabic is a sound based language as opposed to a text/letter based language. These sound differences are extremely important in Arabic and even more important in terms of Quran and Islam. 

If we take a look at the english language. The word *schedule* when pronounced as *skedule* has the same meaning as when it is pronounced as *shedule*. In Arabic, this changes the meaning dramatically. For example:

This is pronounced as *wallahu aaleemun*. 

<Image src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/968119334360739843/1101168071017766922/image-removebg-preview.png?width=288&height=122" width={200} height={200} alt="Allahu aleemun"></Image>
This is pronounced as *wallahu aleemun*. 

This tiny change in sound, would drastically change the meaning. The first would be saying Allah is All Knowing. The second one would suggest Allah is painful. Astagfirullah! This is why proper recitation is so important.

However, it is not just  matter of how you sound it. Even if you change the duration of a sound, it can change the meaning entirely. In English, if you pronounce *tomato* or *tomatooo* it has no difference in meaning. In Arabic, this is very important. For example:

<Image src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/968119334360739843/1101173888752291910/image.png?width=222&height=111" width={200} height={200} alt="halaqnaaa"></Image>
This is pronounced as *halaqnaaa*. 

<Image src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/968119334360739843/1101174039290069022/image.png?width=222&height=128" width={200} height={200} alt="Allahu aleemun"></Image>
This is pronounced as *halaqna*.

Once again the meaning changes dramatically. The first one means *We created* and the second one means *Those women created*. Arabic is a sound based language that changes meaning dramatically. 

Until you are knowledgeable enough in Quranic recitation, please try to make Salah behind an Imam as opposed to being an Imam and leading the salah.

It is extremely important to learn to recite Quran properly when you are learning to perfect your salah. We will cover the basics of Tajweed later in this book inshallah. 

<Hadith book="Riyad as-Salihin" number={1007} text={`Abu Lubabah Bashir bin 'Abdul-Mundhir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "He who does not recite the Qur'an in a pleasant tone is not of us."`}></Hadith>

#### Obligatory And Voluntary

Salat is both an obligatory and voluntary duty placed on human beings by Allah subhana wa ta'ala. Some people may be confused how can something be both obligatory and voluntary. To simplify this, there are five times throughout the day that our salat is obligatory for us. However there are other times that we can make salat for further rewards from Allah subhana wa ta’la in this life and the next. Salat is both an obligatory and voluntary duty placed on us.

Although Allah subhana wa ta’la has made this an obligatory duty on us we are still given the free will of choice to choose whether to make salat or not. The best example of what salah is given by thinking about a doctor-patient relationship. Suppose a patient is diagnosed with hypertension and the doctor prescribes the patient to take blood pressure medication. Now although this is an obligatory duty that the patient must take the blood pressure medication he is still able to have  free will to choose to take it or not. Although it is extremely crucial and the doctors remind him, do not forget you HAVE to take this 3 times a day etc… If the patient takes the medication on time every time it is best for him he will not suffer the consequences. If the patient doesn’t take the medication on time or every time he might not feel any different at first but the damage is taking place on the inside. Same way when we miss a salat we may not feel any consequence but on the inside it is not only killing our bodies but even our souls. Salat was prescribed on us by Allah subhana wa ta'ala who is the best of doctors. He is our creator, so he knows more than anyone what is best for our bodies and souls. Some people may still be asking themselves wait why is salat not prayer when almost everyone in the world says it that way.

#### Difference Between Salah And Prayer

As explained earlier salat is a obligatory and voluntary duty which is a repetition of the same words, movements, positions of our bodies, minds, and souls. The best translation of the word prayer would be duaa. A duaa or prayer is something we do at any time or even at all times of the day to ask Allah subhana wa ta’ala so that we may receive something. Some may make pray to receive something they lack, or something they desire, something they wish to improve etc… Basically praying is just asking Allah subhana wa ta’ala for something at any point of time. In order to truly understand the difference, it is important to understand the concept that salat is a repetition of words, movements, and positions of our bodies, minds and souls while making prayer is simply asking Allah subhana wa ta’ala for something. Suppose you are walking down the street to go home and all of a sudden the rain starts pouring down very hard, and you make a prayer to Allah subhana wa ta’ala to stop or slow the rain just a little so you can reach home safely. You don’t stop in the rain on the street and find the direction towards Mecca and start to make 2 rakat nafl.

### Effects of Salah

#### Importance of Salah

Now that we have understood what salat is, it is important to understand why a person should make salah. When a doctor says to take medicine like, Captopril, they will explain that this medication can help fix and prevent all these other issues as well.

Obviously, the reason we make salat is because it is a duty placed on us by Allah subhana wa ta'ala. Any logical person would ask, but why would Allah subhana wa ta'ala need me to make salah. Does it make him more powerful that I make salah? No. Does it make him lose anything if I do not make salah? No. So, why would I be made to make salah at minimum five times a day? Because it is best for us!
