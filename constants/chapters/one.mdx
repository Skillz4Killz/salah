# What is Salah?

<SectionDescription>Do you think Salat is prayer? You are wrong!</SectionDescription>

### Definition of Salah

In order to perfect our salat, we must first understand what salat means. Salat is usually translated into english as prayer, but in fact salat is not prayer. There is no word in the english language that can truly translate salah. In fact, some people may have already noticed that salat has already been spelled in two different ways in this page alone.

#### Salat or Salah?

It is spelled as salat and salah. The reason for this is because in arabic when we say salat in the middle of a sentence it is sounded with a “t” sound but when used at the end of a sentence it is sounded with a “h” sound. Arabic is a sound based language as opposed to a text/letter based language. These sound differences are extremely important in Arabic and even more important in terms of Quran and Islam. 

If we take a look at the english language. The word *schedule* when pronounced as *skedule* has the same meaning as when it is pronounced as *shedule*. In Arabic, this changes the meaning dramatically. For example:

<Image src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/968119334360739843/1101168071017766922/image-removebg-preview.png?width=288&height=122" width={200} height={200} alt="Allahu aaleemun"></Image>
This is pronounced as *wallahu aaleemun*. It means Allah is All Knowing.

<Image src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/968119334360739843/1101168600963891220/image.png?width=288&height=122" width={200} height={200} alt="Allahu aleemun"></Image>
This is pronounced as *wallahu aleemun*. It means Allah is painful. Astagfirullah!

This tiny change in sound, would drastically change the meaning. This is why proper recitation is so important.

However, it is not just  matter of how you sound it. Even if you change the duration of a sound, it can change the meaning entirely. In English, if you pronounce *tomato* or *tomatooo* it has no difference in meaning. In Arabic, this is very important. For example:

<Image src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/968119334360739843/1101173888752291910/image.png?width=222&height=111" width={200} height={200} alt="halaqnaaa"></Image>
This is pronounced as *halaqnaaa*. It means *We created*.

<Image src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/968119334360739843/1101174039290069022/image.png?width=222&height=128" width={200} height={200} alt="Allahu aleemun"></Image>
This is pronounced as *halaqna*. It means *Those women created*.

Once again the meaning changes dramatically. Arabic is a sound based language that changes meaning dramatically.  Until you are knowledgeable enough in Quranic recitation, please try to make Salah behind an Imam as opposed to being an Imam and leading the salah. It is extremely important to learn to recite Quran properly when you are learning to perfect your salah. We will cover the basics of Tajweed later in this book inshallah. 

<Hadith book="Riyad as-Salihin" number={1007} text={`Abu Lubabah Bashir bin 'Abdul-Mundhir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "He who does not recite the Qur'an in a pleasant tone is not of us."`}></Hadith>

#### Obligatory And Voluntary

Salat is both an obligatory and voluntary duty placed on human beings by Allah subhana wa ta'ala. Some people may be confused how can something be both obligatory and voluntary. To simplify this, there are five times throughout the day that our salat is obligatory for us. However there are other times that we can make salat for further rewards from Allah subhana wa ta’la in this life and the next. Salat is both an obligatory and voluntary duty placed on us.

Although Allah subhana wa ta’la has made this an obligatory duty on us we are still given the free will of choice to choose whether to make salat or not. The best example of what salah is given by thinking about a doctor-patient relationship. Suppose a patient is diagnosed with hypertension and the doctor prescribes the patient to take blood pressure medication. Now although this is an obligatory duty that the patient must take the blood pressure medication he is still able to have  free will to choose to take it or not. Although it is extremely crucial and the doctors remind him, do not forget you HAVE to take this 3 times a day etc… If the patient takes the medication on time every time it is best for him he will not suffer the consequences. If the patient doesn’t take the medication on time or every time he might not feel any different at first but the damage is taking place on the inside. Same way when we miss a salat we may not feel any consequence but on the inside it is not only killing our bodies but even our souls. Salat was prescribed on us by Allah subhana wa ta'ala who is the best of doctors. He is our creator, so he knows more than anyone what is best for our bodies and souls. Some people may still be asking themselves wait why is salat not prayer when almost everyone in the world says it that way.

#### Difference Between Salah And Prayer

As explained earlier salat is a obligatory and voluntary duty which is a repetition of the same words, movements, positions of our bodies, minds, and souls. The best translation of the word prayer would be duaa. A duaa or prayer is something we do at any time or even at all times of the day to ask Allah subhana wa ta’ala so that we may receive something. Some may make pray to receive something they lack, or something they desire, something they wish to improve etc… Basically praying is just asking Allah subhana wa ta’ala for something at any point of time. In order to truly understand the difference, it is important to understand the concept that salat is a repetition of words, movements, and positions of our bodies, minds and souls while making prayer is simply asking Allah subhana wa ta’ala for something. Suppose you are walking down the street to go home and all of a sudden the rain starts pouring down very hard, and you make a prayer to Allah subhana wa ta’ala to stop or slow the rain just a little so you can reach home safely. You don’t stop in the rain on the street and find the direction towards Mecca and start to make 2 rakat nafl.

### Effects of Salah

<SectionDescription>Now you know what salat is, but why should anyone make salah?</SectionDescription>

#### Importance of Salah

Now that we have understood what salat is, it is important to understand why a person should make salah. When a doctor says to take medicine like, Captopril, they will explain that this medication can help fix and prevent all these other issues as well.

Obviously, the reason we make salat is because it is a duty placed on us by Allah subhana wa ta'ala. Any logical person would ask, but why would Allah subhana wa ta'ala need me to make salah. Does it make him more powerful that I make salah? No. Does it make him lose anything if I do not make salah? No. So, why would I be made to make salah at minimum five times a day? Because it is best for us!

#### Benefits of Wudu

Wudu is something that is required before making Salah. We will cover this in depth later in the book inshallah. For now, just know that it is a form of cleansing needed before making Salah.

The first and most obvious thing about wudu, is that it improves hygiene. Good hygiene helps to prevent germs from the body and gives a much healthier body. At a minimum, we must make wudu at least one time a day as after waking up we need to make wudu. 

<Hadith book="Sunan Abi Dawud" number={203} text={`Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The eyes are the leather strap of the anus, so one who sleeps should perform ablution.`}></Hadith>

When doing wudu we clean some of the most likely areas on our body to become dirty. It cleanses our body and gives all muslims a great hygiene, assuming wudu is done properly. All the way from the top of our head to the toes of our feet are cleansed and also given a massage to rejuvenate the body, skin and muscles. It is not just about pouring water on these areas but properly rubbing those areas.

<Hadith book="Sahih al-Bukhari" number={60} text={`Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr: Once the Prophet (ﷺ) remained behind us in a journey. He joined us while we were performing ablution for the prayer which was over-due. We were just passing wet hands over our feet (and not washing them properly) so the Prophet (ﷺ) addressed us in a loud voice and said twice or thrice: "Save your heels from the fire."`}></Hadith>

On average, wudu can be broken very easily and for the majority wudu is often needed to be repeated several times a day. This means as a muslim, you clean your feet more times a day than most people clean their faces.

Just take a minute and think about the benefits of washing your hands, mouth, nose, face, ears, head, arms, and feet five times a day. A good hygiene not only keeps us healthy but can also help prevent spread of germs and infections to others. 

Cleansing the mouth in wudu, also helps promote better dental, bad breath and much more. It helps remove germs, allergens, dust, when done properly helping prevent viral infections.

Hand washing is an efficient way to prevent spread of germs.  Gargling during ablution (Wudu) is very important as it helps to remove germs, allergens and dust particles. Gargling also reduces viral respiratory infections. Gargling ensures reduction in bad breath too. 

Take another minute to think of all the benefits that each portion of wudu can have on a human body.

However, it is of the utmost importance for a muslim to keep in mind that everything we listed above are NOT the reason why you must make wudu. This is just the wisdom and benefits behind the wudu. The reason you make wudu is because it is a command of Allah subhana wa ta'la.

#### Benefits of Salah

Making salat by focusing helps improve a person focus and concentration on tasks helping them become more successful. Salat is one of the best ways for relieving stress, anxiety, tensions, anger and much more. When they are focused on making salat, they become at peace, surrendering them self to the will of Allah subhana wa ta'ala. This helps relieve a lot of mental pressure and doing it five times a day is extremely beneficial to the mind.

It also helps us be humble, it teaches us about equality and unity. When we make salat, we stand shoulder to shoulder and feet to feet alongside everyone facing one point in unison. No matter if you are poor or rich, royalty or not, black, white, brown, yellow no color makes a difference we are equal. 

The changes in positions during salat also help build muscle, tone, flexibility and helping with joint problems, losing weight, blood circulation and much more however these positions need to be done properly. Get that perfect toned body! Most of all it helps a lot with a person's posture. 

It is recommend to make salat is places of worship together like masjid. By making it a routine, to go to a masjid five times a day you can improve social skills and help decrease depression.

When a person makes salat, they are to be focused on that task alone. This is a state of mind in salah when we stand in front of Allah and fully direct our minds and hearts towards Him. It is a single-minded immersion of oneself with a deep focus on the activity at hand and one that leads to maximum performance. Being in a good state of mind, makes us feel livelier and more productive, and life generally seems more fulfilling especially since your state of mind effects every part of your life. But again, we don't focus on this for these reasons but because we are submitting to Allah subhana wa ta'la. When you make salat, you are having a conversation with Allah subhana wa ta'ala.

<Hadith book="Sahih Muslim" number="395a" text={`Abu Huraira reported: The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) said: If anyone observes prayer in which he does not recite Umm al-Qur'an, It is deficient [he said this three times] and not complete. It was said to Abu Huraira: At times we are behind the Imam. He said: Recite it inwardly, for he had heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) declare that Allah the Exalted had said: I have divided the prayer into two halves between Me and My servant, and My servant will receive what he asks. When the servant says: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the universe, Allah the Most High says: My servant has praised Me. And when he (the servant) says: The Most Compassionate, the Merciful, Allah the Most High says: My servant has lauded Me. And when he (the servant) says: Master of the Day of judg- ment, He remarks: My servant has glorified Me. and sometimes He would say: My servant entrusted (his affairs) to Me. And when he (the worshipper) says: Thee do we worship and of Thee do we ask help, He (Allah) says: This is between Me and My servant, and My servant will receive what he asks for. Then, when he (the worshipper) says: Guide us to the straight path, the path of those to whom Thou hast been Gracious not of those who have incurred Thy displeasure, nor of those who have gone astray, He (Allah) says: This is for My servant, and My servant will receive what he asks for. Sufyan said: 'Ala b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Ya'qub narrated it to me when I went to him and he was confined to his home on account of illness, and I asked him about it.`}></Hadith>

It is most important to remember that even if we could list every benefit we could think of, there may still be benefits we may not be aware of. Using the example from before, a doctor may prescribe Captopril to help with controlling blood pressure but it may also be having other effects you might not know about like helping prevent kidney or heart disease. Similarly, the one who knows the benefits of salat best is Allah subhana wa ta'ala as he is the one who created these bodies and souls. There are most probably benefits to salat that we could never even consider or comprehend.
 
Now that we understand what salat is and how important and beneficial it can be, we need to understand how did we learn how to make salat properly?

### Al Isra' Wal Miraj

<SectionDescription>The story of how salat was ordained on us through prophet Muhammad peace be upon him.</SectionDescription>

#### The Year Of Sorrow

Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam, became a prophet at the age of 40 years old. On the 10th year of his prophethood(in other words, when he was 50 years old), he would be given some of the biggest trials by Allah subhana wa tala.

##### The Death of Abu Talib

He would lose his greatest protector, his uncle Abu Talib. During the ten years of prophethood, the people of Mecca would threaten, harm, and endanger prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam. His uncle Abu Talib, who was not a muslim, would protect him and allow him to continue teach Islam in Mecca. Abu Talib, was the son of Abdul Mutalib, who was best described as the leader of Mecca in his time.

When Abu Talib died, there was no longer anyone that could protect prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam from Abu Lahab and other disbelievers that would try and kill him. Not only was Abu Talib a protector and uncle but he was also the one who practically raised prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam since both his parents and his grandfather Abdul Muttalib passed away. It was a huge loss prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam.

Unfortunately, this was only the beginning as a couple months later he would now lose his beloved wife Khadija radi-allahu anha.

##### The Death of Khadija

Khadija radi-allahu anha was prophet Muhammad's sallallahu alaihi wasallam rock. When something would happen he would go to her. When the angel Jibrael would descend onto prophet Muhammad for the first time and reveal the first verse, he ran to was his wife. The one he confided in was his wife. She was the one who would keep him strong in faith. After being mocked, attacked, and defiled he would find comfort in his wife.

The love that he had for his wife is clearly evident as he was never able to forget her.

##### Every Hardship Has A Relief

Any harship that a person suffers always comes with a form of relief. 

<Ayah surah={94} ayah={5}></Ayah>
<Ayah surah={94} ayah={6}></Ayah>

In order to really drive this point home, Allah subhana wa ta'ala repeats the verse. Imagine the gravity of importance something needs to have to have a verse repeated in the glorious Qur'an. 

With prophet Muhammad having gone through the year of sorrow, he would be blessed with Al Isra' wal Miraj.

##### The Journey To Jannah

It is important to note that this was a time when he did not have a protector anymore, the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam even after suffering would still go and maintain his faith. This faith and strength was rewarded by Allah subhana wa ta'la. 

<Hadith book="Sahih Muslim" number="163" text={`Anas b. Malik reported: Abu Dharr used to relate that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The roof of my house was cleft when I was in Mecca and Gabriel descended and opened my heart and then washed it with the water of Zamzam. He then brought a gold basin full of wisdom and faith and after emptying it into my breast, he closed it up. Then taking me by he hand, he ascended with me to th heaven, and when we came to the lowest heaven, Gabriel said to the guardian of the lowest heaven: Open. He asked who was there? He replied. It is Gabriel. He again asked whe he there was someone with him. He replied: Yes, it is Muhammad with me. He was asked if he had been sent for, He (Gabriel) said: Yes. Then he opened (the gate). When we ascended the lowest heaven (I saw) a man seated with parties on his right side and parties on his left side. When he looked up to his right, he laughed and when he looked to his left, he wept. He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and the righteous son. I asked Gabriel who he was and he replied: He is Adam (peace be upon him) and these parties on his right and on his left are the souls of his descendants. Those of them on his right are the inmates of Paradise and the parties which are on his left side are the inmates of Hell; so when he looked towards his right side, he laughed, and when he looked towards his left side, he wept. Then Gabriel ascended with me to the second heaven. He asked its guardian to open (its gate), and its guardian replied in the same way as the guardian of the lowest heaven had said. He (opened it). Anas b. Malik said: He (the Holy Prophet) mentioned that he found in the heavens Adam, Idris, Jesus, Moses and Abraham (may peace be on all of them), but he did not ascertain as to the nature of their abodes except that he had found Adam in the lowest heaven and Abraham in the sixth heaven. When Gabriel and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed by Idris (peace be upon him) he said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous brother. He (the narrator) said: He then proceeded and said: Who is he? Gabriel replied: It is Idris. Then I passed by Moses (peace be upon him) and he said: Welcome tothe righteous apostle and righteous brother. I said to (Gabriel): Who is he? He replied: It is Moses. Then I passed by Jesus and he said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous brother. I said (to Gabriel): Who is he? He replied: Jesus, son of Mary. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then I went to Ibrahim (peace be upon him). He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous son. I asked: Who is he? He (Gabriel) replied: It is Abraham. Ibn Shihab said: Ibn Hazm told me that Ibn 'Abbas and Abd Habba al-Ansari used to say that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Thereafter he ascended with me till I was taken to such a height where I heard the scraping of the pens. Ibn Hazm and Anas told that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah then made fifty prayers obligatory for my Ummah and I returned with that and passed by Moses. Moses, (peace be upon him) said: What has thy Lord enjoined on thy people? I said: Fifty prayers have been made obligatory on them. Moses (peace be upon him) said: Return to thy Lord, for thy Ummah would not be able to bear this burden. Then I came back to my Lord and He remitted a portion out of thut. I then again went to Moses (peace be upon him) and informed him about it He said: Return to thy Lord, for thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden. I then went back to my Lord and He said: They are five and at the same time fifty, and what has been said will not be changed. I then returned to Moses and he said: Go back to thy Lord. whereupon I said: I feel ashamed of my Lord. Gabriel then travelled with me till we came to the farthest lote-tree Many a colour had covered it which I do not know. Then I was admitted to Paradise and saw in it domes of pearls, and its soil of musk.`}>
