            `In order to perfect our salat, we must first understand what salat means. Salat is usually translated into english as prayer, but in fact salat is not prayer. The reason for this confusion is because it is quite difficult to translate the word salat perfectly. In fact, some people may have already noticed that salat has already been spelled in two different ways in this page alone. It is spelled as salat and salah. The reason for this is because in arabic when we say salat in the middle of a sentence it is sounded with a “t” sound but when used at the end of a sentence it is sounded with a “h” sound.`,

            `Salat is both an obligatory and voluntary duty placed on human beings by Allah subhana wa ta'ala. Some people may be confused how can something be both obligatory and voluntary. To simplify this, there are five times throughout the day that our salat is obligatory for us. However there are other times that we can make salat for further rewards from Allah subhana wa ta’la in this life and the next. Salat is both an obligatory and voluntary duty placed on us.`,
            `Although Allah subhana wa ta’la has made this an obligatory duty on us we are still given the free will of choice to choose whether to make salat or not. The best example of what salah is given by thinking about a doctor-patient relationship. Suppose a patient is diagnosed with hypertension and the doctor prescribes the patient to take blood pressure medication. Now although this is an obligatory duty that the patient must take the blood pressure medication he is still able to have  free will to choose to take it or not. Although it is extremely crucial and the doctors remind him, do not forget you HAVE to take this 3 times a day etc… If the patient takes the medication on time every time it is best for him he will not suffer the consequences. If the patient doesn’t take the medication on time or every time he might not feel any different at first but the damage is taking place on the inside. Same way when we miss a salat we may not feel any consequence but on the inside it is not only killing our bodies but even our souls. Salat was prescribed on us by Allah subhana wa ta'ala who is the best of doctors. He is our creator, so he knows more than anyone what is best for our bodies and souls. Some people may still be asking themselves wait why is salat not prayer when almost everyone in the world says it that way.`,

          name: "Difference Between Salah And Prayer",
          text: [
            `As explained earlier salat is a obligatory and voluntary duty which is a repetition of the same words, movements, positions of our bodies, minds, and souls. The best translation of the word prayer would be duaa. A duaa or prayer is something we do at any time or even at all times of the day to ask Allah subhana wa ta’ala so that we may receive something. Some may make pray to receive something they lack, or something they desire, something they wish to improve etc… Basically praying is just asking Allah subhana wa ta’ala for something at any point of time. In order to truly understand the difference, it is important to understand the concept that salat is a repetition of words, movements, and positions of our bodies, minds and souls while making prayer is simply asking Allah subhana wa ta’ala for something. Suppose you are walking down the street to go home and all of a sudden the rain starts pouring down very hard, and you make a prayer to Allah subhana wa ta’ala to stop or slow the rain just a little so you can reach home safely. You don’t stop in the rain on the street and find the direction towards Mecca and start to make 2 rakat nafl.`,

            `Now that we have understood what salat is, it is important to understand why a person should make salah. When a doctor says to take medicine like, Captopril, they will explain that this medication can help fix and prevent all these other issues as well.`,
            `Obviously, the reason we make salat is because it is a duty placed on us by Allah subhana wa ta'ala. Any logical person would ask, but why would Allah subhana wa ta'ala need me to make salah. Does it make him more powerful that I make salah? No. Does it make him lose anything if I do not make salah? No. So, why would I be made to make salah at minimum five times a day? Because it is best for us!`,
